# Day 9

The initial solution uses a variable pointer to track the current marble, and does insert/remove, which is O(n).


After learning how to use a deque, I refactored the solution and it ran significantly faster.

Any attempt to find patterns in the code doesn't seem to work, though I'm pretty sure there could be a nifty mathematical solution in place.
